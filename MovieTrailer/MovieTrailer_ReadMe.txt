    media.py - class definition for the the Movie class that represents individual films.
    
    entertainment_center.py - main application file, which defines the movies and invokes web 
        generation.
    
    fresh_tomatoes.py - Udacity-provided module that contains the code that generates the HTML page
        to display the author's six movie picks.  The module's entry point ids the function 
        open_movies_page().  This function takes a list of Movie instances as its single paramter.
        Note: The author has slightly modified the canned code to also display the storylines.

    launch the default web browser.  (If the browser asks permission to run scipts, please click Yes.)
